# README.md

This README file provides information about the code in this repository.

## Description

The code in this repository reads the contents of a file named "mapa.txt" and stores it in a two-dimensional matrix. Each line from the file represents a row in the matrix. The program reads each line, copies it to the matrix, and then prints the row number and its contents.

## Getting Started

To run the code, follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code files are located.
4. Compile the code using the C compiler. For example, if you are using GCC, run the following command: `gcc -o program program.c`
5. Run the compiled program. Use the following command: `./program`

## File Structure

- `program.c`: The main source code file.
- `mapa.txt`: The input file containing the data to be read.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the `mapa.txt` file exists and contains the desired data.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. The program will read the contents of `mapa.txt`, store them in a matrix, and print each row along with its corresponding row number.
