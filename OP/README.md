# OP Script

## Overview

OP is a script language created by Amy Farrah Fowler. This language allows you to transform text by adding "OP" after each consonant while leaving vowels and spaces unchanged.

## Features

- Converts text by adding "OP" after each consonant.
- Preserves vowels and spaces in the input text.
- Converts all characters to lowercase to ensure proper handling.

## Usage

To use the OP script, follow these steps:

1. Compile the code: Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system. Compile the `op_script.c` file using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc -o op_script op_script.c
